# How I Interview

_Summary: In previous companies I had a lot of freedom to design an interview. This article describes what I came up with._

Over the years, I've interviewed hundreds of candidates for software engineering jobs (at least 500, probably quite a bit more). I've interviewed for many companies, for teams I was setting up, for teams I was managing, for teams I worked in, and for different teams at the same company. In most places, I've been free to set the majority of the interview. This post describes why and how I designed my interview process. I'm making this post now because where I currently work has a pre-existing interview process, so I won't be following the process below anymore.

I have always run my interviews as a complete assessment of a candidate, aiming to form a complete answer. Sometimes I did that as a phone screen, and sometimes as part of a set of interviews, but I never relied on other people to cover different aspects of a candidate. (Well, I did once, and it went badly...)

When interviewing, there are three questions I want to answer for myself, in order of importance.

## Will they be happy here?

If the candidate joined, would they be happy? If people aren't happy, it won't be a pleasant experience, and likely, they won't be very successful. Whether they are happy is the most important criteria because an employee who can't do the job but is happy can be trained or can use their skills for other purposes. But an employee who is unhappy will just drag the morale of the whole team down.

To figure out whether a candidate would be happy, I explain the job (including any office hours/environment/location) and discuss it in contrast to their previous experience. The best person to judge if they would be happy are the candidate themselves - so I ask that question. The tricky part is that it's an interview setting, so they have prepared saying "Yes, that sounds good" to every question. I try and alleviate that by building a rapport with the candidate first, being honest about my experiences, and trying to discuss what they like in the abstract first. If I'm not convinced they are being truthful or properly thinking it through, I ask deeper questions, for example how they like to split their day etc.

A great sign is when a candidate, during the interview, concludes _for themselves_ that this job just isn't what they were looking for. I've had that happen 5 times during the actual interview, and 2 times as an email afterwards. It isn't awkward, and has saved some candidates an inappropriate job (at least 2 would have likely been offered a job otherwise).

While I'm trying to find out if the candidate will be happy, at the same time, I'm also attempting to persuade the candidate that they want to join. It's a hard balance and being open and honest is the only way I have managed it. Assuming I am happy where I work, I can use my enthusiasm to convince the candidate it's a great place, but also give them a sense of what I do.

## Can they do the job?

There are two ways I used to figure out if someone can do the job. Firstly, I discuss their background, coding preferences etc. Do the things they've done in the past match the kind of things required in the job. Have they got experience with the non-technical portions of the job, or domain expertise. Most of these aspects are on their CV, so it involves talking about their CV, past projects, what worked well etc.

Secondly, I give them a short technical problem. My standard problem can be solved in under a minute in a single line of code by the best candidates. The problem is not complex, and has no trick-question or clever-approach element. The result can then be used as a springboard to talk about algorithmic efficiency, runtime implementation, parallelism, testing, verification etc. However, my experience is that candidates who struggle at the initial problem go on to struggle with any of the extensions, and candidates that do well at the initial question continue to do well on the extensions. The correlation has been so complete that over time I have started to use the extensions more for candidates who did adequately but not great on the initial problem.

My approach of an incredibly simple problem does not seem to be standard or adopted elsewhere. One reason might be that if it was used at scale, the ability to cheat would be immense (I actually have 2 backup questions for people I've interviewed previously).

Given such a simple question, there have been times when 5 candidates in a row ace the question, and I wonder if the question is just too simple. But usually then the next 5 candidates all struggle terribly and I decide it still has value.

## Will I be happy with them doing the job?

The final thing I wonder is would I be happy with them being a part of the team/company. The usual answer is yes. However, if the candidate displays nasty characteristics (belittling, angry, racist, sexist, lying) then it's a no. This question definitely isn't code for "culture fit" or "would I go for a beer with them", but specific negative traits. Generally I answer this question based on whether I see these characteristics reflected in the interactions I have with the candidate, not specific questions. I've never actually had a candidate who was successful at the above questions, and yet failed at this question. I think approximately 10 candidates have failed on this question.
